# GlaucoLens

**GlaucoLens** is a web-based glaucoma detection system that uses image processing and deep learning to analyze retinal (fundus) images. The application features a React.js frontend and a Python-based backend where the machine learning model is trained using Jupyter Notebook.

## üß† Overview

Glaucoma is a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss if not detected early. GlaucoLens aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential glaucoma cases from retinal images using advanced image processing techniques and machine learning.

## ‚ú® Features

- Upload fundus images to detect signs of glaucoma.
- Image preprocessing and analysis using OpenCV and deep learning.
- React.js frontend for an interactive user experience.
- Trained deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras in Python.
- Jupyter Notebook used for training and evaluation of the model.
- RESTful API backend (Flask or FastAPI) for prediction integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask (or FastAPI)
- **Model Training**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Jupyter Notebook
- **Others**: Git, GitHub, Axios (for frontend-backend communication)
